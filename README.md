### Food Ease for foodies! 

Take Photos of your food, we'll give you a recipe and nutritional data!

## How It Works

Reading any .jpg files in the path defined, we load them into Google's Cloud-Vision-API giving us the ingredient name. From there we poll Edamam's API to give us the nutritional and Recipe information. Passing these in a JSON format to the Front-end where we pick it up using JavaScript. The Back-end is wrapped in Flask allowing for accessible ports and passing the information through.

## What It looks like
